# Sudoku-BackTracking

# Project Description:
Sudoku Solver Using Backtracking
# Objective:
Develop a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. The program will take an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and output a solved puzzle if a solution exists. The solver will adhere to the classic Sudoku rules, ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.

# Features:
# Input Handling:
Accept an unsolved Sudoku puzzle in a structured format (e.g., 2D array, text file, or user input).
# Grid Validation: 
Ensure the initial puzzle is valid and respects Sudoku constraints.
# Solving Algorithm: 
Implement the backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
# Output Solution: Display or return the solved puzzle in a readable format:
User Interface (Optional): Create a simple user interface for inputting puzzles and viewing solutions.
# Components:
# Data Structures:
Use a 2D array to represent the Sudoku grid.
# Functions:
# find_empty(grid): 
Locate an empty cell in the grid.
# is_valid(grid, row, col, num):
Check if placing a number in a specific cell is valid.
# solve_sudoku(grid):
Recursively solve the puzzle using backtracking.
# print_grid(grid):
Display the grid in a readable format.


Find an empty cell: Search the grid for an empty cell (represented by 0 or another placeholder).
Try possible numbers: For each number from 1 to 9, do the following:
Check validity: Use the is_valid function to check if placing the number in the current cell respects Sudoku rules.
Place the number: Temporarily place the number in the cell if it is valid.
Recursively attempt to solve: Call solve_sudoku recursively to solve the rest of the grid.
Backtrack: If placing the number leads to a contradiction, remove it and try the next number.
